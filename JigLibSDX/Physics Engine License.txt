-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Beta
- HighFrequency code REFERENCE's. (Especially operator overloads for Vector3 and Matrix structs) (mostly done)
  Replace matrix0 = matrix1*matrix2 with Matrix.Multiply(ref matrix1,ref matrix2, out matrix0)
  Design Guidelines:
  + Public methods never have a ref parameter
  + Use ref parameters for structs in internal/private classes only whent its high frequency code
    (In the detection classes for example)
  + Mark reference calls with #region REFERENCE or manual inline calls with #region INLINE
- Distance,Overlap and Intersect classes have to be optimized
- REFACTORIZE
